# Text-Analysis

## Overview

Text Analysis involves extracting meaningful insights from unstructured text data, such as documents, emails, social media posts, and more.  
This project aims to demonstrate various text analysis techniques using Python.

For text analysis, I utilized a dataset containing articles with the following attributes:

- Article text
- Article title

You can download the dataset [here](https://statso.io/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Topic-Modelling.zip).

Furthur the process I followed is as below

- Gather the text data
- Clean and preprocess the text data
- Convert the text into a numerical format that machine learning algorithms can understand
- Analyze the text data to gain insights
- Create relevant features from the text data if necessary
- Select appropriate NLP model for my task

## Results

### Word Cloud of Titles

Visualize the most frequent words in the article titles.

### Topic Distribution

Uncover latent topics within the articles using topic modeling techniques.
